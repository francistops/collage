# collage
## don't expect anything from it, but it's a start

The idea is to collabe on something anything and in the process get use to github workflow.
mistake are allowed and even encourage. there noting sensitive or critical here and the real reward is the pain and suffering that eventually transform to knowlege and mastery. ( no promises tho :p )
With that said, it may be beneficial to you if try and learn good habit and practice, but you can worry about it later go on make a pull request to main! (if that last sentence did not compute for you plz, do not worry! you'll tell me later. Go on go forth let make stupid things carefree without any espectations of someday this will blosson!
